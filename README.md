# CompletionSorting
implements separate sorting strategies for Pharo code completion

### Setup Info
- needs DataFrame (installation script [here](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/DataFrame)) and NeoCSV (installation script [here](https://github.com/svenvc/NeoCSV)) dependencies loaded
- should already have the data files fetched with this repo

### Sorting Strategies Info
- so far we have a Frequency based sorter (now should be fast!)

### Testing for yourself
- Settings -> Code Completion -> Sorter
- choose `FrequencyCompletionSorter`
